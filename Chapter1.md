5. You create new files. For example, if you want to include a new chapter in your book use nano Chapter and write a content of the chapter. 
6. Onece you done with it, it is important you have to include Chapter 1 in the _toc.hyml file.
7. Once everthing is done, use jupyter-book build my_jupyterbook.
8. Then see the list of the files again and there will be a file _build, go to this file then go to the html and use the commmand python -m http.server. This will give you a link, copy the link and put in internet browser, it will give take you to your book you just created. 
9. Remember every time you made any changes you have to rebuild the book using the command jupyter-book build ny_jupyterbook.
